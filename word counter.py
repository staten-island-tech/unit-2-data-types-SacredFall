# Challenge
#1. Using the "input" method in Python, ask a user to input a sentence. Then develop a function that accepts a the user input and will tell you how many words are in that string. First write out your plan in Pseudo-code using comments. Then craft the function. 


yoursentence = input('What is your sentence: ')

x = yoursentence.split()

print(len(x))
